	<h3>About Compute Freely</h3>
	<p>Compute Freely was started to be a friendly jumping in point for people completely new to the concept of Free and Open Source operating systems and Linux distributions but otherwise have some curiousity about them.</p>
	<p>Unlike some sites, Compute Freely does away with a lot of the technical jargon and pageranking to determine "popularity". Instead it presents some basic info about using Linux and provides a <b>curated</b> list of distributions that may strike a variety of interests or skill levels.</p>
	<p>Plus each distribution gets a simple page with the "essentials"&mdash;we're not keeping the most accurate records or anything&mdash;and people can jump around and explore via tags.</p>
