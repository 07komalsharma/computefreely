## Adding Distributions

Adding a new distribution pages is simply a matter of writing a new post. But each new post requires a certain amount of frontmatter metadata

```yaml
---
layout: post
author: Your Name
title: "Distro Name"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"
logo: ""
image: ""
caption: ""
tags: []
notes:
  homepage: 
  version: ""
  based-on: 
  desktops: []
  developers:
    - name: 
      url: 
---
```

When writing about the distribution you would like to submit, you are free to editorialize, but if you gather information from the project's website do paraphrase as best you can.
