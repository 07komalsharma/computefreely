# Compute Freely

Compute Freely is a website that's meant to be a friendly place to start for the Free & Open Source Software and Linux curious.

## Simple Templating

* PHP-based
* Pages go in root as .php files
* Include `_templates/sitewide.php`, set any variables, then `include $template['header'];` (see [404.php](https://github.com/snwh/computefreely/blob/master/404.php) for an example) at top of page.
* `include $template['footer'];` at bottom of page.
* Page variables:
  * `$page['title']`
  * `$page['description']`
  * `$page['author']`

## Local Development

For a simple local development environment, you will need:

* [A supported version of PHP](http://php.net/supported-versions.php)

Then inside the project directory, run `php -S localhost:8000 router.php` then, open http://localhost:8000/ to view the site.
