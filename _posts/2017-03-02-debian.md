As one of the oldest free software operating systems, Debian is very stable &amp; reliable.However its complex development cycle results in infrequent updates and a tendency to lag behind the competition.

Debian is a Linux distribution developed completely openly and distributioned in the principle of the [GNU Project](http://www.gnu.org/) by the Debian Project. The Debian Project has steadfast adherence to Free Software, having produced a strict [social contact](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) and set of [Free Software guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) to guide the development of Debian and its many contributors.

While the default desktop environment of Debian is GNOME, during installation you can pull from Debian's vast software respository of over 50000 packages to install virtually any other.
