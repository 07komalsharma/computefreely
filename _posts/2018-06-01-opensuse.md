openSUSE is the community-driven edition of the enterprise-class distribution SUSE Linux, whose parent company also serves to sponsor the project.

The project is highly focused on providing tools for system adminstrators, predominately: [YaST](https://yast.github.io/) &ndash;openSUSE's extremely flexible and in-depth installer and control center.
