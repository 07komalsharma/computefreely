Arch Linux is not a distribution for the faint of heart. If you're thinking about using Arch Linux, it presumes you have a great deal of familiarity with the Linux command-line. If you do have  such, installation process is incredyou know what you want to build when starting out presenting you with a blank terminal shell for you to start from scratch. 

Arch offers the blankest of slates for you to build the operating system you want.

That said, if you are comfortable in a terminal window, Arch Linux features robust tools for building your custom system. It's much lauded package manager *pacman*

Its highly-regarded documentation, complemented by the excellent Arch Linux Handbook makes it possible for even less experienced Linux users to install and customise the distribution. The powerful tools available at the user's disposal mean that the distro is infinitely customisable to the most minute detail and that no two installations can possibly be the same.

Besides featuring the much-loved "rolling-release" update mechanism, Arch Linux is also renowned for its fast and powerful package manager called "Pacman", the ability to install software packages from source code, easy creation of binary packages thanks to its AUR infrastructure, and the ever increasing software repository of well-tested packages.
