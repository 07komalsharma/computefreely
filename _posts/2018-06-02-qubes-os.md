Qubes OS is a privacy and security oriented operating system that allows you to compartmentalize (literally) your digital life by isolating applications through virtualization. Qubes creates virtual machines (computers) on the system, called "qubes", to securely silo various parts of your workflow.

Applications running on Qubes OS can be grouped in different "domains", such as "Personal", "Work", "Shopping", "Banking", etc. and to keep the system from being exposed to network attackes Qubes OS also isolates all networking activity into its own domain.
